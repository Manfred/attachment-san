Attachment-San

  Plugin for easy and rich attachment manipulation.

  Although the ideas behind Attachment-San are different, it borrows heavily on both attachment_fu and acts_as_attachment by Rick Olson. 

Dependencies

  General: A recent Rails (at least 2.0, though it's most often tested on Edge)
  Development: test/spec and SQLite3
