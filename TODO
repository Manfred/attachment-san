* Make it actually work with more than one attachment class.
  * has_attachment :watermark, :superclass => WatermarkSuperclass
  * has_attachment :watermark, :class => WatermarkClass
* Nest created classes under the superclass.
* Do we need to sanitize the original filename, eg lowercase.
* Make :filename_scheme => :record_identifier also use nesting under parent resources. Eg /resources/1/images/2/filename
